        WIRED Monash and UNIHACK is pleased to announce that we're launching
        another hackathon - UNIHACK Mini!
      </p>
      <p>
        UNIHACK Mini is our hackathon for first-time hackers, and is only open
        to Monash University students.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might ask yourself, what is a hackathon? Other than spending time
        with your mates making an app/website/game/whatever, it's an event where
        you can practice your coding skills while being mentored by the best of
        the best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams of four students have 27 hours to create a prototype of their
        idea, and get feedback from our mentors before pitching them to our
        panel of judges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coders, designers, thinkers - whatever your talent is, regardless of
        skill level, come and participate in UNIHACK Mini!
