        <h3>Diversity</h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, there are some groups that are underrepresented in the IT community. These groups
          include (but are not limited to) women, people of colour, the LGBTQIA+ community, people with
          disabilities, and those from economically or socially disadvantaged backgrounds who would be
          unable to attend without some financial assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We value diversity and inclusion at UNIHACK Sydney, and believe expressing and offering support
          is the first step to progress. As such, we like to invite competitors from these
          underrepresented backgrounds to apply for the Diversity Scholarship, so that
          we can support you with a discounted entry!
