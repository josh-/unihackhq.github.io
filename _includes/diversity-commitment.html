      <h3><span>Diversity Commitment</span></h3>
      <p>
        The organisers of UNIHACK are committed in increasing the diversity of UNIHACK competitors. We
        will be collaborating with Women in ICT and Engineering groups across Australia to help promote
        the event. We will also collaborate with ICT and Engineering groups that represent LGBT students
        to ensure they are also represented at UNIHACK.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are also committed in producing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
        gender, age, sexual orientation, disability and religion. All persons involved in UNIHACK are
        required to comply with the terms set out in the Hack Code of Conduct this year &mdash; including
        attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff.
