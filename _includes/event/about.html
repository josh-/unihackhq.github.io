          Inspired by the student hackathons in the United States and Europe, UNIHACK was created in 2014 by WIRED Monash.
          Since the very first competition at York Butter Factory, UNIHACK has quickly become one of the go-to hackathons
          for university students nationwide.

        <p>
          Now, for the first time, UNIHACK is expanding to the wonderful city of Sydney - wih the help of SUITS, the IT
          student society at the University of Sydney.

          The main purpose of UNIHACK is to showcase the best and talented students currently residing in our universities
          - the very people who will become the next generation of developers, thinkers, and startup entrepreneurs.

          Teams have 24 hours to design and build something awesome. It can be anything - a website, a mobile application,
          a video game, or even something hardware. The important thing is that it needs to work when it is presented to
          the judges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you are an avid programmer or a first-timer, UNIHACK welcomes all types of "hackers" regardless of
          skill level.
