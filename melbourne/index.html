      <h3>Venue</h3>
      <p class="address">Monash Business School</p>
      <p class="address">Lv 7, 271 Collins Street</p>
      <p class="address">Melbourne, VIC 3000</p>

      <h4>How do I get there?</h4>
      <p>
        The best way to get to 271 Collins Street is to catch a train to Flinders
        Street Station, and walk to Flinders Lane via the Degraves Street exit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you can catch the 11, 12, 48, 70, 75 or 109 tram to Elizabeth
        Street; then walk the rest of the way to the venue via Flinders Lane.
      </p>

      <h4>Where can I park?</h4>
      <p>
        If you are driving in, the nearest 24-hour car park is 300 Flinders Street,
        which is a four minute walk away from 27 Collins Street.
        Please be aware that this is a paid car park. There is no parking on-site.

        <h3>Diversity</h3>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, there are some groups that are underrepresented in the IT community. These groups
          include (but are not limited to) women, people of colour, the LGBTQIA+ community, people with
          disabilities, and those from economically or socially disadvantaged backgrounds who would be
          unable to attend without some financial assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          We value diversity and inclusion at UNIHACK Melbourne, and believe expressing and offering support
          is the first step to progress. As such, we like to invite competitors from these
          underrepresented backgrounds to apply for the Diversity Scholarship, so that
          we can support you with a discounted entry!
