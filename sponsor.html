        <p class="intro">Come and join us in the Imagination Revolution </p>
        <p>
          Since 2014, our mission is to create an environment that encourages software engineering, design and product creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sponsoring UNIHACK is a great way to support, nurture and connect with the top IT students from Australia's leading
          unviersities - the very people who will become the next generation of developers, thinkers and entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now located in two cities - Melbourne and Sydney - UNIHACK in 2018 promises to be the biggest year ever, with more
          than 200+ students competing in each city.

          This is the best time to sponsor UNIHACK - here’s exactly why...
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Recruit amazing talent:</strong> Since 2014, we’ve attracted and provided access to the best
            upcoming junior tech talent in the country. Our hackers and alumni have gone on and worked at some
            of our top-tier technology and engineering companies (many of whom are our sponsors).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Attend and engage with students:</strong> Send mentors and guests to support and engage with
            student participants directly. Watch students as they plan, build and pitch their solutions outside
            a classroom or assessment centre setting.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Real-time adoption of products and feedback:</strong> Get hackers to adopt your product and
            collect feedback. They’ll be hacking away, trying new things and experimenting on how to bring your
            services, hardware, APIs or tooling to the next level, in ways you have not thought of before.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Brand recognition and exposure:</strong> Show off your company’s technical side through various
            means – such as social media promotion, tech workshops, and API/hardware demos. Make your name known
            Australia-wide to students and align your brand with student innovation and creativity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Promote your organisation’s graduate and internship programs</strong>  through our social media
            channels and Careers Fair.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Say that you supported UNIHACK</strong>, an event that is bringing up a new generation of talent
            in Australia.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The organisers of UNIHACK are committed in increasing the diversity of UNIHACK competitors. We
          will be collaborating with Women in ICT and Engineering groups across Australia to help promote
          the event. We will also collaborate with ICT and Engineering groups that represent LGBT students
          to ensure they are also represented at UNIHACK.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also committed in producing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
          gender, age, sexual orientation, disability and religion. All persons involved in UNIHACK are
          required to comply with the terms set out in the Hack Code of Conduct this year &mdash; including
          attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff.
