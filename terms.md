### UNIHACK Competitor Refund Policy

Unfortunately we cannot offer refunds for any competitor tickets, however you are able transfer your ticket to another student willing to compete.

Our [Facebook Group](https://facebook.com/groups/unihackers/) is the recommended medium to find other students looking for tickets.

### UNIHACK Company Sponsorship Refund Policy

Since sponsorship goes directly into the running of hackathons and takes effect immediately, we cannot offer refunds for sponsorship.

We may however be able to offer compensation in credit towards another year of sponsorship.
