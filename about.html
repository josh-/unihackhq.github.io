        <h3><span>Who are we?</span></h3>
        <p class="intro">
          We are Australia's largest and premier student hackathon - run for students, by students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by the student hackathons in the United States and Europe, UNIHACK was created in 2014
          by Terence Huynh from WIRED Monash. Since the very first competition at York Butter Factory, UNIHACK has quickly
          become one of the go-to hackathons for university students nationwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main purpose of UNIHACK is to showcase the best and talented students currently residing in our
          universities &mdash; the very people who will become the next generation of developers, thinkers, and
          startup entrepreneurs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teams have 24 hours to design and build something awesome. It can be anything - a website, a mobile
          application, a video game, or even something hardware. The important thing is that it needs to work
          when it is presented to the judges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you are an avid programmer or a first-timer, UNIHACK welcomes all types of "hackers"
          regardless of skill level.

        <p>
          The organisers of UNIHACK are committed in increasing the diversity of UNIHACK competitors. We
          will be collaborating with Women in ICT and Engineering groups across Australia to help promote
          the event. We will also collaborate with ICT and Engineering groups that represent LGBT students
          to ensure they are also represented at UNIHACK.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are also committed in producing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
          gender, age, sexual orientation, disability and religion. All persons involved in UNIHACK are
          required to comply with the terms set out in the Hack Code of Conduct this year &mdash; including
          attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff.
