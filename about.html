      <p class="intro">
        We are Melbourne's premier student hackathon - run for students, by students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by the student hackathons in the United States and Europe, UNIHACK was created in 2014
        by WIRED Monash. Since the very first competition at York Butter Factory, UNIHACK has quickly
        become one of the go-to hackathons for university students nationwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main purpose of UNIHACK is to showcase the best and talented students currently residing in our
        universities &mdash; the very people who will become the next generation of developers, thinkers, and
        startup entrepreneurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teams have 24 hours to design and build something awesome. It can be anything - a website, a mobile
        application, a video game, or even something hardware. The important thing is that it needs to work
        when it is presented to the judges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you are an avid programmer or a first-timer, UNIHACK welcomes all types of "hackers"
        regardless of skill level.
      </p>
      <p>
        UNIHACK is organised by WIRED Monash, the IT student society at Monash University Clayton.
